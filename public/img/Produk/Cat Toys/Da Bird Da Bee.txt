Da Bird Da Bee

Hand made in the USA with natural, Da Bird’s Bee Wand is set on long wire to drive your cat wild. By encouraging instinctual behaviour, your cat will exercise while playing, keeping them healthy and alert. Just don’t leave your cat alone with it because cats literally love them to pieces!

This wand-style cat toy features lifelike insects that attract your cat almost as well as real ones. The incredibly durable Bee Wand gives you fantastic action just by turning the handle with your thumb and forefinger. The attached wire makes the movement of the insects erratic and realistic.
